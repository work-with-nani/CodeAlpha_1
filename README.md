# Iris Flower Classification

This project builds a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their measurements using Python and Scikit-learn.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples with 4 features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The goal is to predict the species of the iris based on these features.

---

## Approach

1. **Data Loading**: Loaded the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn.
2. **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20 split).
3. **Feature Scaling**: Standardized the features for better model performance.
4. **Model Training**: Used Logistic Regression to train the classifier.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessed the model's accuracy and generated a classification report.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: The model achieved approximately X% accuracy on the test data.
- **Performance Metrics**: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for each class are included in the classification report.

*(Replace `X` with actual accuracy after running the code)*
